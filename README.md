# Daily Mail - Home (Placeholder)

This is a simple placeholder Home page built with PHP, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and minimal JavaScript. It uses PHP arrays for news content and displays four main sections in this order:

1. Pasted Image 1 (Hero)
2. Pasted Image 2 (Personal Feed)
3. Pasted Image 3 (Main Feed)
4. Pasted Image 4 (Category Strip)

The contact `tips@dailymail.com` is a clickable `mailto:` link.

## Run locally (Windows PowerShell)

1. Open PowerShell in this folder (`c:\Users\katrina mae\Documents\CIT\HCI - Daily Mail`).
2. Start PHP's built-in server:

```powershell
php -S localhost:8000
```

3. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000/index.php`

Notes:
- Placeholder images are loaded from `via.placeholder.com`.
- Edit the PHP arrays in `index.php` to change content.
